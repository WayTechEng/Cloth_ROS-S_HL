6. Modify the IP address in ROSConnector GameObject properties. Leave the socket field untouched
7. Next, go to File -> Build Settings. 
8. Switch to Universal Windows Platform. Set Architecture to x86 if building for HoloLens 1, ARM64 if building for HoloLens 2.
9. Hit Build. Save it to a folder or leave it in the App Folder.
10. Head into the folder you saved the built solution to, and open the VS Solution.
11. Change the Solution Configuration to Release, Solution platform to x86 if building for HoloLens 1, ARM64 if building for HoloLens 2.
12. Set Device to Device (Ensure Hololens is connected via USB to your Computer).
